Some of my customized configuration files for my Linux laptop, including the theme I have applied to my window manager (sway with waybar, wofi, etc) and a couple of applications (e.g., nvim, alacritty, mpv). I contribute ports to the Everforest color scheme and also apply those colors to my desktop, with some modifications.
